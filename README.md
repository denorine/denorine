# The Denorine Project
The Denorine Project Goal is to create a hyper extensible bot framework perfect for your server.<br>
Want a music bot? Host denorine and do `d!dpm install NyleCohen/Transponder`<br>
Want an anime bot? No problem, `d!dpm install transGirl-alice/nekos4life`
### Installation
The bot isn't yet public, check back soon for installation instructions!
### Goals
* Implement an easy to use api (ehh :\\) (done)
* Implement a package manager (done)
* Add a sfw flag (lets hope most people using this bot are over 18 for now) (not planned for near future)
* Make a version for multiple servers and include server sandboxing (yeah I think I learned my lesson) (not planned for near future)
* Make a better security system apparently (welp) (done)
